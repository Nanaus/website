<h2 style=text-align:center;"> This is all about me. </h2>

<h3 style=text-align:center;font-family:arial bold> My name is Nur Farahana bt Rosli. 
<br>
<br>
 I am 24 years old. I stay at Station 18, Ipoh Perak. 
<br>
<br>
I live with my parents at there.
<br>
<br>
Today i will tell you all about me and my family.
<br>
<br>
My hobbies are singing, listening to songs and hangout with my friends.
<br>
<br>
My ambition are to be a bussinesswoman or kindergarden teacher.
<br>
<br>
About my favourite colour are black and pink because I love BLACKPINK korean group.
<br>
<br>
 Because I love listening to music, there are many singers that I love and adore.
<br>
<br>
 For example of course BLACKPINK, BIG BANG, ARIANNA GRANDE, AVRIL LAVIGNE and most of them
<br>
<br>
are English singer. If I want to list their songs, I think there are a lot that 
<br>
<br>
 I have to write. And I also loves Hindustan songs and movies but not all. 
<br>
<br>
 Animal that love the most are CATS. I really loves cat because they are so cute 
<br>
<br>
 and fluffy. I have 8 cats at my home and two were sent to Johor because my cousin 
<br>
<br>
 want to adopt them. But 3 weeks ago, my most favourite cat have died. 
<br>
<br>
 Its name is SHEMBAM. It died because ingested poison. It took 3 days for me
<br> 
<br>
 get rid of the sadness because its the only cat that I took care a lot. 
<br>
<br>
 Enough about my stories, so now lets go to see my experience and more.
<br>
<br>
 about me. LOTS OF LOVE :)  </h3>
